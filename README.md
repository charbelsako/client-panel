# How is this different form the udemy course of Traversy Media

I added settings in firebase so every user has his own setting.
Currently if 2 people use the same phone/laptop/etc they will get the same settings.

A few UI changes.
Stuff kind of broke when I tried viewing it on my phone so I had to adjust the grid
